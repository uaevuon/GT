# Guardian Tales Image Classification

This project implements an image classification system for Guardian Tales characters using a fine-tuned MobileNetV3 model.

## Requirements

- **PyTorch**: This project is built with PyTorch. Ensure you have it installed in your environment. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Submodule

This GitHub repository includes a submodule **[GTbooru](https://github.com/uaevuon/GTBooru)**.

## Model

The image classification system utilizes **MobileNetV3** for efficient model performance. The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset of Guardian Tales character images.

## Annotation

For annotating the images, **Label Studio** was used. This tool helps in managing the labeling process efficiently.
